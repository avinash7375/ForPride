### ðŸ§® **Section A: Operators (10 Questions)**

1. **Arithmetic Operators:**
   Write a Python program to input two numbers and display their **sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder**.

2. **Exponentiation and Floor Division:**
   Take two integers `a` and `b` from the user. Print `a**b` (power) and `a//b` (floor division).

3. **Assignment Operators:**
   Initialize a variable `x = 10`. Use compound assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`) and print the result after each operation.

4. **Relational Operators:**
   Input two numbers and check if the first number is **greater than**, **less than**, **equal to**, or **not equal to** the second.

5. **Logical Operators:**
   Write a program that takes three Boolean inputs and prints the result of `and`, `or`, and `not` combinations.

6. **Bitwise Operators:**
   Input two integers and print their **AND (&)**, **OR (|)**, **XOR (^)**, **NOT (~)**, **Left Shift (<<)**, and **Right Shift (>>)** results.

7. **Membership Operators:**
   Check if the character `'a'` is present in the string `"apple"`, and if `'z'` is not in `"banana"`.

8. **Identity Operators:**
   Create two lists with the same values and check if they are the **same object** using `is` and `is not`.

9. **Combined Expression:**
   Evaluate the expression `5 + 3 * 2 > 10 and not 4 == 4` and print the result with an explanation in comments.

10. **Operator Precedence:**
    Demonstrate how operator precedence affects results by comparing:

```python
x = 10 + 3 * 2
y = (10 + 3) * 2
print(x, y)
```

### ðŸ”€ **Section B: Conditional Statements (10 Questions)**

11. **Basic If Statement:**
    Write a program to input a number and check if it is **positive**.

12. **If-Else:**
    Check whether a number entered by the user is **even or odd**.

13. **Nested If:**
    Input a number and determine whether it is **positive**, **negative**, or **zero**.

14. **If-Elif-Else:**
    Write a program to input marks and print the **grade** according to the following rule:

* 90â€“100: A
* 75â€“89: B
* 50â€“74: C
* Below 50: Fail

15. **Largest of Three Numbers:**
    Input three numbers and print which one is the **largest** using nested `if` statements.

16. **Leap Year Check:**
    Write a Python program to check whether a given year is a **leap year**.

17. **Character Classification:**
    Input a character and check whether it is an **uppercase letter**, **lowercase letter**, **digit**, or **special symbol**.

18. **Simple Calculator:**
    Ask the user to enter two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). Perform the operation using `if-elif` statements.

19. **Eligibility Check:**
    Input a person's age and check if they are **eligible to vote (18 or older)**.

20. **Nested Condition â€“ Discount Calculation:**
    Input the total purchase amount and customer type (`regular` or `premium`).
