Sure! Here are **10 problem-solving questions** — **5 using `while` loops** and **5 using `for` loops** — that you can use for practice (in any programming language like Python, C, Java, etc.).

## 🌀 **While Loop Problems (5 Questions)**

1. **Sum of Digits**
   Write a program that takes an integer as input and uses a `while` loop to calculate and print the sum of its digits.
   *Example:*
   Input: `1234` → Output: `10`

2. **Reverse a Number**
   Using a `while` loop, reverse a given integer and print the reversed number.
   *Example:*
   Input: `5678` → Output: `8765`

3. **Count the Number of Digits**
   Use a `while` loop to count how many digits are in a given number.
   *Example:*
   Input: `90876` → Output: `5`

4. **Guess the Number Game**
   Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 10.
   Use a `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user to guess until they get it right.

5. **Print Multiplication Table**
   Take a number `n` and use a `while` loop to print its multiplication table up to 10.
   *Example:*
   Input: `n = 5` → Output: `5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50`

## 🔁 **For Loop Problems (5 Questions)**

1. **Sum of N Natural Numbers**
   Write a program using a `for` loop to find the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
   *Example:*
   Input: `n = 5` → Output: `15`

2. **Factorial of a Number**
   Using a `for` loop, find the factorial of a given number `n`.
   *Example:*
   Input: `n = 4` → Output: `24`

3. **Print All Even Numbers Between 1 and 50**
   Use a `for` loop to print all even numbers between 1 and 50.

4. **Print a Star Pattern**
   Using a `for` loop, print the following pattern for a given number of rows:

   ```
   *
   **
   ***
   ****
   *****
   ```

5. **Find the Largest Element in a List**
   Given a list of numbers, use a `for` loop to find and print the largest number in the list.
   *Example:*
   Input: `[3, 7, 2, 9, 5]` → Output: `9`
