Computer Science
Computer:
it is a device that let's machines (Any mechanical or electronic device), under and think 
like humans.

Artificial Intelligence(AI)

Binary numbers (Language that is understandable my machines.)

BCD - Binary Coded Decimal. 	- 0000-ffff - 0-15 - 0000 - 1111.
EBCDIC - Extended BInary Coded Decimal. - 7 bit - 1 - 0000,  1 - 0000000.
ASCII - American Standard COde For Information INterchanage. 
- 8 bit=1 byte, 0 - 00000000, f - 11111111

# python - Is a Programming language - Used to - give system calls to a computer.
It is a a High-level programming language.
It is very easy to use and implement.

IDLE - Integrated Development Environment.

Assembler, Interpreter, Compiler

Assembler - direct system calls to a computer.
Interpreter - It used to convert, single line of code at once.
MOV - 001001001
m - 091091091
c - oiwhdladl
Compiler - It used to convert a block of code at once.
Python is simple and fast.


we are going to study from tutorials and glossary.

# syntax - A way to write a program

print("Something!!")

# Indentation Error - when you give more spaces.


# proper keywords

variable = 

integeer - 0 to n
floating - 1.234, 3.14
char - "Anythinf, *, ad"
boolean = True

OPerators
Arithmetic - +, -, *, /, %, //
When using modulus(%), we get the output as Remainder of the division of 2 number.
When using Truncate(//), we get the output as Quotient with decimals of the division of 2 numbers.
Logical - 
Bitwise
Assignment
relational
