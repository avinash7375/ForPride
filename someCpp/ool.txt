In your code, there are several operator overloads:

Arithmetic operators:


operator + (addition)
operator - (subtraction)
operator * (multiplication)
operator / (division)


Increment operators:


operator ++() (prefix increment)
operator ++(int) (postfix increment - note the int parameter which distinguishes it from prefix)


Comparison operators:


operator < (less than)
operator > (greater than)
operator == (equality)

For example, when you write n1 + n2 in your code, the compiler calls n1.operator+(n2) behind the scenes. Similarly, when you write n1 > n2, it calls n1.operator>(n2).
This allows your custom Number class to work with standard C++ operators in an intuitive way, just like built-in types.
